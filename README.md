               Everybody would have played the old minesweeper, where we have to click on the board on the cells which do not have a mine. And obviously we don’t know where mines are. If a cell where a mine is present is clicked then we lose, else we are still in the game.  The increasing number of tiles raises the difficulty bar. So the complexity level increases as we proceed to next levels.It might seem like a complete luck-based game (you are lucky if you don’t step over any mine over the whole game and unlucky if you have stepped over one). But this is not a complete luck based game.We can win almost everytime if we follow some tricks and hacks.When we click on a cell having adjacent mines in one or more of the surrounding eight cells, then we get to know how many adjacent cells have mines in them. So we can do some logical guesses to figure out which cells have mines.If you click on a cell having no adjacent mines (in any of the surrounding eight cells) then all the adjacent cells are automatically cleared, thus saving our time.So we can see that we don’t always have to click on all the cells not having the mines (total number of cells – number of mines) to win. If we are lucky then we can win in very short time by clicking on the cells which don’t have any adjacent cells having mines.
